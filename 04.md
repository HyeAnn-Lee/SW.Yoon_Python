* example

      >>> r1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      >>> r2 = [x*2 for x in r1]
      >>> r2
      [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
 
* conditional statement


      >>> r1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      >>> r2 = [x*2 for x in r1 if x%2]
      >>> r2
      [2, 6, 10]
  
* nested loop

      >>> r1 = ['s', 't']
      >>> r2 = ['1', '2', '3']
      >>> r3 = [i+j for i in r1 for j in r2]
      >>> r3
      ['s1', 's2', 's3', 't1', 't2', 't3']

* nested loop + conditional statement

      >>> r = [n*m for n in range(2, 6) for m in range(1, 6) if (n*m)%2]
      >>> r
      [3, 9, 15, 5, 15, 25]
